# CCNA Course With Lazaro (Laz) Diaz on Udemy.com
I modified an excel spreadsheet originally provided by Laz for converting from Hex to Dec and Vice Versa
The download is a macro enable excel spreadsheet. The file is macro enabled because I had to create VBA code 
to perform bitwise calculations since I only have excel 2007 and it doesn't come with bitwise functions.
